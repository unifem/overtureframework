\section{Introduction}

Cgins\footnote{Thanks to Kyle Chand for all his contributions to Cgins including
the development of the AFS algorithm.} is an incompressible fluid flow solver for overlapping grids built upon
the \Overture framework~\cite{Brown97},\cite{Henshaw96a},\cite{iscope97}.
More information about
{\bf Overture} can be found on the \Overture home page, {\tt http://www.llnl.gov/\-casc/\-Overture}.


Cgins
solves the incompressible Navier-Stokes
equations using a pressure-Poisson formulation~\cite{ICNS}. Second-order accurate and
fourth-order accurate approximations are available.  Cgins can be used to
\begin{itemize}
  \item solve problems in two and three dimensional complex domains,
  \item solve problems on moving grids (specified motion and rigid body motion), 
  \item solve temperature dependent flows with buoyancy using the Boussinesq approximation,  
  \item solve axisymmetric flows.
%   \item solve for visco-plastic flows (Bingham plastics). 
\end{itemize} 
This user guide describes how to get started and how to run Cgins. Various examples are given.
The options for running the code along with specification of initial conditions and
boundary conditions are described.

\subsection{Basic steps}\index{basic steps}
Here are the basic steps to solve a problem with Cgins.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Generate an overlapping grid with ogen. Make the grid with 2 ghost lines (this is the default).
  \item Run cgins (note lowercase 'c', found in the {\tt bin/cgins} directory) 
        and choose the PDE you want to solve.
  \item Assign the boundary conditions and initial conditions.
  \item Choose the parameters for the PDE (Reynold's number, Mach number etc.)
  \item Choose run time parameters, time to integrate to, time stepping method etc.
  \item Compute the solution (optionally plotting the results as the code runs).
  \item When the code is finished you can look at the results (provided you saved a
     `show file') using {\tt plotStuff}.
\end{enumerate}
The commands that you enter to run cgins can be saved in a \Index{command file} (by default
they are saved in the file `cgins.cmd'). This command file can be used to re-run
the same problem by typing `cgins file.cmd'. The command file can be edited to change parameters.

To get started you can run one of the demo's that come with cgins, these are 
explained next in section~(\ref{sec:demo}).

Papers that describe some of the \Index{algorithms} used in Cgins include
\begin{enumerate}
  \item {\sl A Fourth-Order Accurate Method for the Incompressible
            {N}avier-{S}tokes Equations on Overlapping Grids} \cite{ICNS},
  \item {\em A Split-Step Scheme for the Incompressible {Navier-Stokes} Equations}~\cite{splitStep2003},
  \item {\sl Composite Overlapping Meshes for the Solution of Partial Differential Equations}
        \cite{CGNS},
  \item {\sl Analysis of a Difference Approximation for the Incompressible
            Navier-Stokes Equations} \cite{INSDIV}.
         
\end{enumerate}

\section{Sample command files for running cgins} \label{sec:demo}

Command files are supported throughout the Overture. They are files
that contain lists of commands. These commands can initially be saved
when the user is interactively choosing options.  The \Index{command files}
can then be used to re-run the job. Command files can be edited and
changed.

In this section we present a number of command files that can be used
to run cgins. See the file {\tt cg/ins/cmd/Readme} for a list and brief description of
the command files found in {\tt cg/ins/cmd}. 

% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Running a command file}

Given a \Index{command file} for cgins such as {\tt cylinder.cmd}, found in {\tt
cmd/cylinder.cmd}, one can type `{\tt cgins cylinder.cmd}' to run this command
file . You can also just type `{\tt cgins cylinder}, leaving off the {\tt
.cmd} suffix. Typing `{\tt cgins noplot cylinder}' will run without
interactive graphics (unless the command file turns on graphics). Note that here
it is assumed that the {\tt bin} directory is in your path so that the {\tt
cgins} command is found when you type it's name. The Cgins sample
command files will automatically look for an overlapping grid in the {\tt
Overture/sampleGrids} directory, unless the grid is first found in the location
specified in the command file.

When you run a command file a graphics screen will appear and after some
processing the run-time dialog should appear and the initial conditions will be
plotted, see Figure~\ref{fig:runTimeScreen}. The program will also print out some information about the problem
being solved. 
Many of the command files such as the stirring-stick problem, {\tt stir.cmd},
can take command line arguments.  For example, here
are two command lines that run a problem with different grids and parameters:
\begin{verbatim}
  cgins stir -g=stir.hdf -nu=.05 -tf=1. -tp=.025 
  cgins stir -g=stir2.hdf -nu=.01 -tf=1. -tp=.002 -rate=8.
\end{verbatim}
See the comments at the top of {\tt stir.cmd} for further explanation and examples.

% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Incompressible flow past a cylinder in a long channel}

The command file {\tt cg/ins/cmd/cylinder.cmd} can be used
to compute the incompressible flow past a cylinder in a channel, see Figure~\ref{fig:cylinder}.
This example uses the grid {\tt Overture/\-sampleGrids/cilc.hdf}.

    projecting a uniform flow, $(u,v)=(1,0)$. Right: the solution at time $t=40$.}
  \label{fig:cylinder}
\end{figure}
}

To run cgins with the {\tt cylinder.cmd} script, type
\begin{flushleft}
  \tt cgins \$ins/cmd/cylinder.cmd
\end{flushleft}
% At this point choose {\tt continue} or {\tt movie mode}.
Then choose one of:
\begin{flushleft}
  {\tt continue} : to advance to the next output time. \\
  {\tt plot component} : to plot different solution components. \\
  {\tt streamlines} : to plot streamlines (choose {\tt erase first}). \\
  {\tt grid} : to plot the grid (choose {\tt erase first}). \\
  {\tt movie mode} : to run and plot. \\
  {\tt break} : to break from movie mode. \\
  {\tt final time 50.} : to increase the final time.
\end{flushleft}
Further description of the options available in the
run time dialog can be found in Section~\ref{sec:runTimeDialog}.
\vskip.5\baselineskip
{\bf Note:} If cgins cannot find the cilc.hdf grid file, you can generate it with: 
\begin{flushleft}
  \tt ogen -noplot \$sampleGrids/cilc.cmd
\end{flushleft}

Here are some more examples using the command line arguments to choose different options:
\begin{flushleft}
  {\tt cgins cylinder -g=cilc.hdf -tf=50. -tp=1.} : specify the grid, final time and time to plot. \\
  {\tt cgins cylinder -g=cilce2.order4 -tf=50. -tp=.1 -nu=.01} : solve a fourth-order accurate 
         problem~\footnote{By default, Cgins determines the order of accuracy from the grid: the order of accuracy
         of the grid is specified when the grid is constructed using ogen. A fourth-order accurate grid will have two
     layers of interpolation points (to support a 5 point stencil) and use high-order accurate interpolation with a
     interpolation stencil width of 5 in each direction.}. 
\end{flushleft}


% To run this command file from the {\tt cmd} directory type {\tt `cgins cylinder'}
% (or {\tt ../bin/cgins cylinder'} if you have not set your path). 

\noindent {\bf Notes:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item If the overlapping grid file, {\tt cilc.hdf} is not found then you may need to specify
        the full path to its location, {\tt -g=/home/henshaw/myGrids/cilc.hdf}. The suffix {\tt `.hdf'}
        is optional when specifying grids as Overture will tack on {\tt `.hdf'} if necessary.
        If Cgins does not  find the file specified it will also by default look for the file in the
        {\tt Overture/\-sampleGrids} directory. 
  \item The initial conditions are assigned to be a uniform flow, $(u,v)=(1,0)$. 
        These initial conditions are projected to nearly satisfy $\grad\cdot\uv=0$
        by using the {\tt `project initial conditions'} option (see~\cite{CginsReferenceManual}).
  \item The time-stepping method is chosen so that the grid around the cylinder
         uses implicit time-stepping while the back-ground grid uses explicit time-stepping.
        This was done for efficiency. The grids around the cylinder have small grid spacings so that
        implicit time stepping is especially useful. The back-ground grid does not have small grid spacings
        so there is not much of an advantage in using implicit time stepping.
        By treating the back-ground grid explicitly the implicit time stepping equations 
        require less storage and cpu time to solve.
  \item By default the implicit equations and elliptic pressure equation are solved with a direct sparse solver. This usually
        is the best approach for 2D problems, unless the grids get large, since the matrix is factored
        only once. In later examples it will be shown how to specify an iterative method.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Flow past two cylinders using different time-stepping methods}

In this section we compute the flow past two cylinders in order
to demonstrate the use of some different time-stepping methods for Cgins.
These time-stepping methods include the explicit predictor-corrector (PC), the implicit predictor-corrector (IM)
the approximate factored scheme (AFS), and the (pseudo) steady-state line solver (SS). 
Figure~\ref{fig:tcilc} shows two grids at different resolutions(-factor=2,4 with -order=2 as described below) and the solution (on a grid -factor=8, -order=4).

  \label{fig:tcilc}
\end{figure}
}

The examples in this section use the Cgins command file {\tt cg/ins/cmd/tcilc.cmd}.
This script optionally takes numerous command line arguments that can be used to change parameters: 
\begin{flushleft}\tt
 cgins [-noplot] tcilc -g=<grid-name> -nu=<> -tf=<> -tp=<> -show=<> -debug=<> -project=[0|1] -ad2=[0|1] -ad4=[0|1] -ad41=<> -ad42=<> ... 
         -ts=[pc|im|afs|ss] -solver=[best|mg|yale] -psolver=[best|mg|yale] -rtolp=<>  \\
~~ \\
\quad -tf, -tp: final time and times to plot. \\
\quad -show : name of show file. \\
\quad -project : 1=project initial conditions to be approximate divergence free. \\
\quad -ad2 : 1=turn on 2nd-order artificial dissipation. \\
\quad -ad4 : 1=turn on 4th-order artificial dissipation. \\
\quad -ad41, -ad42 : coefficients in fourth-order non-linear dissipation. \\
\quad -ts : time-stepping method. \\
\quad -solver : linear solver for implicit time-stepping equation. \\
\quad -psolver : linear solver for the pressure equation. \\
\quad -rtolp : relative convergence tolerance for the pressure equation solver.
\end{flushleft} 


The different grids used in this section can be computed with the Ogen command
file {\tt Overture/sampleGrids/tcilc.cmd}. Here are some examples 
\begin{flushleft}
  {\tt ogen -noplot tcilc -order=2 -interp=e -factor=2} : [tcilce2.order2.hdf] \\
  {\tt ogen -noplot tcilc -order=2 -interp=e -factor=4} : [tcilce4.order2.hdf] \\
  {\tt ogen -noplot tcilc -order=2 -interp=e -ml=3 -factor=8}: [tcilce8.order2.ml3.hdf]
\end{flushleft}
The {\tt -factor} option specifies the grid resolution factor: the grid spacing is approximately 
$0.1$ divided by this factor. 
The {\tt -ml} option indicates that the grid should support at least this many multigrid
levels (needed if the multigrid solver is used as a linear solver).


Here is a list of commands that can be used to simulate the flow using different time-stepping methods and parameters.
\begin{flushleft}
\noindent{\bf PC22} : second-order accurate predictor corrector, Yale direct sparse solver for pressure:\\
{\tt cgins tcilc -g=tcilce4.order2 -ts=pc -nu=1.e-4 -ad2=1 -tp=.05 -tf=5.-debug=3 -psolver=yale -show="tcilc.show" -go=halt}\\
 ~~ \\
%
\noindent{\bf IM22} : second-order accurate implicit predictor corrector (viscous terms implicit), PETSc BiCG-Stab ILU(3) implicit solver and pressure solver:\\
{\tt cgins -noplot tcilc -g=tcilce32.order2 -ts=im -nu=.2e-4 -ad2=1 -tp=.1 -tf=10. -solver=best -psolver=best -rtolp=1.e-4 -go=go}\\
~~  \\
%
\noindent{\bf PC24} : second-order accurate in time, fourth-order accurate in space, predictor corrector, multigrid pressure
solver:\\
{\tt cgins tcilc -g=tcilce32.order4.ml4 -ts=pc -nu=.2e-4 -ad4=1 -tp=.5 -tf=5. -psolver=mg -rtolp=1.e-4 -go=halt}\\
~~  \\
%
\noindent{\bf IM24} : second-order accurate in time, fourth-order accurate in space, implicit predictor corrector, multigrid implicit solver, multigrid pressure
solver, (note: decrease ad42 coefficient to avoid time-step restriction):\\
{\tt cgins tcilc -g=tcilce16.order4.ml3 -ts=im -nu=1e-4 -ad4=1 -ad42=.1 -tp=.1 -tf=5. -solver=mg -psolver=mg -rtolp=1.e-4 -debug=3 -go=halt}\\
~~  \\
%
\noindent{\bf AFS24} : second-order accurate in time, fourth-order accurate in space predictor corrector, multigrid pressure
solver:\\
{\tt cgins tcilc -g=tcilce32.order4.ml4 -nu=.2e-4 -ad4=1 -ts=afs -cfl=4 -tp=.1 -tf=.2 -psolver=mg -rtolp=1.e-4 -go=halt}\\
~~  \\
%
\noindent{\bf SS2} : second-order accurate pseudo-steady-state line solver (local time stepping), MG pressure solver
solver:\\
{\tt cgins -noplot tcilc -g=tcilce4.order2.ml2 -nu=.1 -ts=ss -plotIterations=100 -maxIterations=5000 -psolver=mg -show="tcilc.show" -go=go} \\
~~  \\
%
\noindent{\bf IM22-FI} : second-order accurate full-implicit solver:\\
{\tt cgins tcilc -g=tcilce2.order2 -nu=.1 -ts=im -implicitVariation=full -implicitFactor=1. -refactorFrequency=20 -tp=.5 -tf=100. -dtMax=.1 -solver=yale -psolver=yale -plotResiduals=1}
\end{flushleft}


{\bf Note:} The implicit methods (IM22, IM24 and AFS24) are generally faster when there is a fine boundary layer grid since the viscous terms
        generally require explicit schemes to have a small time-step. 

{\bf Note:} The Yale direct sparse solver is usually fastest linear solver for small to moderate size 2D problems. The MG solver is
      otherwise generally the fastest. 

{\bf Note:} The AFS solver can run at CFL numbers bigger than one. Currently this requires some trial and error to determine
    how to choose the {\tt -cfl} parameter and other AFS parameters, see Section~\ref{sec:AFSparameters} for more details. 

{\bf Note:} The generally fastest overall solver for bigger problems, or moving grid problems is AFS24 with the MG pressure solver. 

{\bf Note:} The SS2 solver is very memory efficient and is useful for problems where time accuracy is not important or for
    low Reynolds number flows where the solution reaches a steady state.

{\bf Note:} The full implicit solver IM22-FI treates the momentum equations with all terms implicit (expect the pressure gradient).
     This method requires more memory.

% The solution is not exactly symmetric but note that the computation of the initial conditions
% through a projection is not currently computed in a symmetric way.

% If you run this example you will notice messages printed to the effect that the \Index{divergence} is
% large on some parts of the grid. By looking at the show file with {\tt plotStuff} and plotting the
% divergence it can be seen that the divergence is large near the leading edge where there are
% large gradients in the solution. This is not unexpected when using artificial diffusion since
% only a minimal amount of smoothing is added. However, it could also indicate
% that either I need a more refined grid there or perhaps a better discretization method such as 
% a finite volume method might work better.

This example demonstrates the use of the second-order non-linear \Index{artificial diffusion} (described in the
Cgins reference guide~\cite{CginsReferenceGuide}). The default value for $\nu=10^{-8}$ is much too
small to have any affect on the solution for the grid being used. 
The value of the artificial diffusion is determined in a local way
that depends on the velocity gradients so as to keep the solution nicely behaved but
with a minimum of dissipation. There is sometimes some fiddling required to get the coefficients
of the artificial diffusion correct. The values are usually always around be $.1$ and $5.$.

\subsection{Incompressible flow past a backward facing step, a C-Grid and an H-grid}
\index{backward facing step}\index{C-grid}\index{H-grid}

The command files {\tt cg/ins/cmd/backStep.cmd}, {\tt cg/ins/cmd/cgrid.cmd} and
{\tt cg/ins/cmd/hgrid.cmd} can be used to solve the problems illustrated in this section.
All of these grids use the {\sl mixed boundary} condition feature, where portions of a 
physical boundary interpolate from another grid. The grids can be generated with the command files
{\tt Overture/sampleGrids/backStep.cmd}, {\tt Overture/sampleGrids/cgrid.cmd} and
{\tt Overture/sampleGrids/hgrid.cmd}.

In general it is preferable NOT to use grids that have been generated with a {\sl mixed boundary}. 
For example, the flow around the convex corner in the backward facing step is not well resolved. 
It is recommended to round off convex corners. See the command file {\tt cg/ins/cmd/backStepSmooth.cmd} 
for flow past a back step with a smoothed corner.

For 3D problems it is almost always necessary to use an iterative solver
for the pressure equation and the implicit time stepping equations. The PETSc linear
solvers are recommended. Iterative solvers require a convergence tolerance and you may
have to play around with this tolerance (if the tolerance for the pressure equation
is too large, then the divergence may grow large). 
See the Oges documentation\cite{OGES}
for more information on linear solvers.
% In the above case we use the GMRES solver with a convergence tolerance of
% $10^{-3}$. You may have to play around with this tolerance since I don't
% have a good automatic way to do this yet.

\section{Hints for running cgins}\index{hints for running}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Start out with a simple problem on a coarse grid so that the problem
      can be quickly run to determine if you have the boundary conditions correct etc.
  \item Start out by taking only a few time steps and looking at the solution to
      see if it looks correct.
  \item The rule of thumb for choosing the viscosity $\nu$ is that if the velocities
    are order 1 and the domain is order 1 then $\nu > h_{\rm max}^2$, where 
    $h_{\rm max}$ is the maximum grid spacing as reported by cgins when it runs.
    This comes from the minimum scale result as discussed in section~(\ref{AD}).
  \item If you want to use as small a viscosity as possible then set $\nu=0$
    and use \Index{artificial diffusion} as discussed in section~(\ref{sec:pdeOptions}).
  \item If cgins blows up it could be the time step is not computed correctly. Reduce
   the cfl parameter (default is .9) to a value like .5 or .25 to see if this is the problem.
   There are known problems with the time step determination for implicit time stepping and
   a large viscosity (relative to the grid spacing).
\end{itemize}

\section{Trouble Shooting and Frequently asked Questions}\index{trouble shooting}

{\bf Question:} I wonder what is the meaning of this error and what can I do to avoid it.
\begin{verbatim}
computeNumberOfStepsAndAdjustTheTimeStep:ERROR: time step too small? dtNew=1.560026e-61, timeInterval=7.314242e-04
 t=3.699269e+00, tFinal=6.000000e+00, nextTimeToPrint=3.700000e+00, tPrint=1.000000e-03
error
Overture::abort: I am now going to purposely abort so that you can get a traceback from a debugger
Abort
\end{verbatim}

This error usually occurs when the solution develops an instability and gets very
large ({\em blows up} being the technical term). The computed time step will
then be very small. This situation may be caused by a number of factors.

The first thing to do is to look at the solution just before it blows up. If
there are oscillations developing in the interior of the domain or near a
no-slip wall or interpolation boundary then you probably do not have enough
dissipation. Increase the real viscosity $\nu$, or increase the number of grid
points or increase the artificial dissipation and re-run the problem to see if
it runs longer. It could also be that the time step being chosen is too large or
not being re-computed often enough. Decrease the cfl number to see if it has an
effect.  You can also decrease the number of time steps between recomputing the
time step with a command like {\tt recompute dt every 15}. 

The solution may also blow up if the flow enters the domain at an outflow boundary.
This could happen if a strong vortex leaves the domain. You can set the option
{\tt check for inflow at outflow} and then the outflow boundary condition
will be changed if there is inflow detected. You may also be able to 
move the outflow boundary farther downstream to reduce this problem.

 \item build  PETSc on your machine.
\item define the PETSC\_LIB and PETSC\_ARCH environmental variables (as required to use PETSc normally).
\item edit the file {\tt cg/ins/Makfile} and turn on the PETSc option.
