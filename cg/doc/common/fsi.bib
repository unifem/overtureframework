abstract = {The finite volume method with exact two-phase Riemann problems (FIVER) is a two-faceted computational method for compressible multi-material (fluid–fluid, fluid–structure, and multi-fluid–structure) problems characterized by large density jumps, and/or highly nonlinear structural motions and deformations. For compressible multi-phase flow problems, FIVER is a Godunov-type discretization scheme characterized by the construction and solution at the material interfaces of local, exact, two-phase Riemann problems. For compressible fluid–structure interaction (FSI) problems, it is an embedded boundary method for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) capable of handling large structural deformations and topological changes. Originally developed for inviscid multi-material computations on nonbody-fitted structured and unstructured grids, FIVER is extended in this paper to laminar and turbulent viscous flow and FSI problems. To this effect, it is equipped with carefully designed extrapolation schemes for populating the ghost fluid values needed for the construction, in the vicinity of the fluid–structure interface, of second-order spatial approximations of the viscous fluxes and source terms associated with Reynolds averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS)-based turbulence models and large eddy simulation (LES). Two support algorithms, which pertain to the application of any embedded boundary method for CFD to the robust, accurate, and fast solution of FSI problems, are also presented in this paper. The first one focuses on the fast computation of the time-dependent distance to the wall because it is required by many RANS-based turbulence models. The second algorithm addresses the robust and accurate computation of the flow-induced forces and moments on embedded discrete surfaces, and their finite element representations when these surfaces are flexible. Equipped with these two auxiliary algorithms, the extension of FIVER to viscous flow and FSI problems is first verified with the LES of a turbulent flow past an immobile prolate spheroid, and the computation of a series of unsteady laminar flows past two counter-rotating cylinders. Then, its potential for the solution of complex, turbulent, and flexible FSI problems is also demonstrated with the simulation, using the Spalart–Allmaras turbulence model, of the vertical tail buffeting of an F/A-18 aircraft configuration and the comparison of the obtained numerical results with flight test data.

The scheme uses so-called Combined Field with Explicit Interface (CFEI) advancing formulation based on the Arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian approach with finite element procedure. Although loosely-coupled partitioned schemes are often popular choices for simulating \{FSI\} problems, these schemes may suffer from inherent instability at low structure to fluid density ratios. We show that our second-order scheme is stable for any mass density ratio and hence is able to handle strong added-mass effects. Energy-based stability proof relies heavily on the connections among extrapolation formula, trapezoidal scheme for second-order equation, and backward difference method for first-order equation. Numerical accuracy and stability of the scheme is assessed with the aid of two-dimensional fluid--structure interaction problems of increasing complexity. We confirm second-order temporal accuracy by numerical experiments on an elastic semi-circular cylinder problem. We verify the accuracy of coupled solutions with respect to the benchmark solutions of a cylinder-elastic bar and the Navier–Stokes flow system. To study the stability of the proposed scheme for strong added-mass effects, we present new results using the combined field formulation for flexible flapping motion of a thin-membrane structure with low mass ratio and strong added-mass effects in a uniform axial flow. Using a systematic series of fluid--structure simulations, a detailed analysis of the coupled response as a function of mass ratio for the case of very low bending rigidity has been presented. "

The fluid is discretized using a discontinuous Galerkin method on unstructured tetrahedral meshes, and the structure uses a high-order volumetric continuous Galerkin finite element method. Standard radial basis functions are used for the mesh deformation. The time integration is performed using a partitioned approach based on implicit–explicit Runge–Kutta methods. The resulting scheme fully decouples the implicit solution procedures for the fluid and the solid parts, which we perform using two separate efficient parallel solvers. We demonstrate up to fifth order accuracy in time on a non-trivial test problem, on which we also show that additional subiterations are not required. We solve a benchmark problem of a cantilever beam in a shedding flow, and show good agreement with other results in the literature. Finally, we solve for the flow around a thin membrane at a high angle of attack in both 2D and 3D, and compare with the results obtained with a rigid plate. "

The influence of Reynolds number on the response of isolated cylinders is presented and recent developments using forced vibration are discussed. The response of a cylinder free to respond in the in-line and transverse directions is contrasted with that of a cylinder responding in only one direction. The interference between two circular cylinders is discussed and prominence given to the case of cylinders in a tandem arrangement. The origin of the time–mean lift force on the downstream cylinder is considered together with the cause of the large amplitude transverse vibration experienced by the cylinder above vortex resonance. This wake-induced vibration is shown to be a form of vortex-induced vibration. "

abstract = "A partitioned coupling approach for time-dependent fluid--structure interactions is applied to thin shells and membranous structures with large displacements. The frame algorithm connects a three-dimensional, finite volume-based multi-block flow solver for incompressible fluids with a finite element code for geometrically nonlinear structural problems using a commercial coupling interface. Thus a high modularity is achieved and the whole range of opportunities with these two powerful codes — each of them highly adapted to its specific field of application — can be used also for coupled simulations. Two completely different configurations were investigated. First, the coupling algorithm was applied to an academic test configuration consisting of one, two, and three flexible L-shaped plates being loaded by a steady far-field flow. Various investigations were carried out at different Reynolds numbers (Re=50,200, and 500) in order to study phenomena such as vortex shedding, resonance, influence of the interaction between several flexible plates, whereas the second and third plates were placed in the wake of the first. The second part of the paper shows that in principle the coupling procedure can also deal with real-life structures as they occur in civil engineering. A membranous roof of glass-fiber synthetics with a complex shape was exposed to a time-dependent wind gust from diagonally above which was superimposed on a constant basic wind flow parallel to the ground. The structural model contains the pre-stressed textile roof including the taut cables at its circumference which are fastened at the pylons. As a structural response, the wind gust led to a displacement of the textile roof which disappeared again when the gust subsided. With the coupled algorithm proposed in the paper it is possible to study dynamic interactions for engineering applications. "

In this paper the coupled algorithm will first be applied to some geometrically simple test cases to validate the interaction scheme.

We present an efficient approximate implementation of the preconditioners, based on a Schur complement approximation for the Navier-Stokes block and the use of multigrid approximations for the solution of the computationally most expensive operations. The performance of the the preconditioners is examined in representative steady and unsteady simulations which show that the \{GMRES\} iteration counts only display a mild dependence on the Reynolds number and the mesh size.

abstract = "Blood velocity and pressure fields in large arteries are greatly influenced by the deformability of the vessel. Moreover, wave propagation phenomena in the cardiovascular system can only be described considering wall deformability since blood is usually described as an incompressible fluid. However, computational methods for simulating blood flow in three-dimensional models of arteries have either considered a rigid wall assumption for the vessel or significantly simplified or reduced geometries. Computing blood flow in deformable domains using standard techniques like the \{ALE\} method remains a formidable problem for large, realistic anatomic and physiologic models of the cardiovascular system. We have developed a new method to simulate blood flow in three-dimensional deformable models of arteries. The method couples the equations of the deformation of the vessel wall at the variational level as a boundary condition for the fluid domain. We consider a strong coupling of the degrees-of-freedom of the fluid and the solid domains, and a linear membrane model (enhanced with transverse shear) for the vessel wall. The effect of the vessel wall boundary is therefore added in a monolithic way to the fluid equations, resulting in a remarkably robust scheme. We present here the mathematical formulation of the method and discuss issues related to the fluid-solid coupling, membrane formulation, time integration method, and boundary and initial conditions. Implementation is discussed and results with simple geometries as well as large subject-specific models are presented. "

We employ a partitioned method for the fluid and structure motions in conjunction with sub-iteration and Aitken relaxation. In particular, the use of such fictitious parameters requires sub-iterations in order to reduce the induced error in addition to the local temporal truncation error. To this end, proper levels of tolerance for terminating the sub-iteration procedure have been obtained in order to recover the formal order of temporal accuracy. For the coupled \{FSI\} problem, these fictitious terms have a significant effect, leading to better convergence rate and hence substantially smaller number of sub-iterations. Through analysis we identify the proper range of these parameters, which we then verify by corresponding numerical tests. We implement the method in the context of spectral element discretization, which is more sensitive than low-order methods to numerical instabilities arising in the explicit \{FSI\} coupling. However, the method we present here is simple and general and hence applicable to \{FSI\} based on any other discretization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method in applications involving 2D vortex-induced vibrations (VIV) and in 3D flexible arteries with structural density close to blood density. We also present 3D results for a patient-specific aneurysmal flow under pulsatile flow conditions examining, in particular, the sensitivity of the results on different values of the fictitious parameters.

   abstract    = {In this article we address the numerical simulation of
                 fluid--structure interaction (FSI) problems featuring
                 large added-mass effect. We analyze different
                 preconditioners for the coupled system matrix obtained
                 after space- time discretization and linearization of the
                 FSI problem. The classical Dirichlet-Neumann
                 preconditioner has the advantage of ``modularity''
                 because it allows to reuse existing fluid and structure
                 codes with minimum effort (simple interface
                 communication). Unfortunately, its performance is very
                 poor in case of large added-mass effects. Alternatively,
                 we consider two non-modular approaches. The first one
                 consists in preconditioning the coupled system with a
                 suitable diagonal scaling combined with an ILUT
                 preconditioner. The system is then solved by a Krylov
                 method. The drawback of this procedure is that the
                 combination of fluid and structure codes to solve the
                 coupled system is not straightforward. The second
                 non-modular approach we consider is a splitting technique
                 based on an inexact block-LU factorization of the linear
                 FSI system. The resulting algorithm computes the fluid
                 velocity separately from the coupled pressure-structure
                 system at each iteration, reducing the computational
                 cost. Independently of the preconditioner, the efficiency
                 of semi-implicit algorithms (i.e., those that treat
                 geometric and fluid nonlinearities in an explicit way) is
                 highlighted and their performance compared to the one of
                 implicit algorithms. All the methods are tested on
                 three-dimensional blood-vessel systems. The algorithm
                 combining the non-modular ILUT preconditioner with Krylov
                 methods proved to be the fastest.},

These methods generalize the arguments reported in [13, 10] to the case of the coupling with thick-walled structures. The basic idea lies in the derivation of an intrinsic interface Robin consistency at the space semi-discrete level, using a lumped-mass approximation in the structure. The fluid-solid splitting is then performed through appropriate extrapolations of the solid velocity and stress on the interface. Based on these methods, a new, parameter-free, Robin-Neumann iterative procedure is also proposed for the partitioned solution of implicit coupling. A priori energy estimates, guaranteeing the (added-mass free) stability of the schemes and the convergence of the iterative procedure, are established. The accuracy and robustness of the methods are illustrated in several numerical examples.}},

This is due, in particular, to the increasing interest of the research community in the simulation of blood flows in large arteries. In this context, the fluid equations have to be solved in a moving domain and the incompressibility constraint makes the coupling sensitive to the added-mass effect. As a result, the solution procedure has to be designed carefully in order to guarantee efficiency without compromising numerical stability. In this paper, we review some of the coupling schemes recently proposed in the literature. Some numerical results that show the effectiveness of the novel approaches are also presented.}},

For a linear model problem, we prove that the scheme is stable, in the energy norm, irrespectively of the so-called added-mass effect, namely, the fluid--structure density ratio and the geometry of the domain.

As a result, a coupling algorithm is needed to enforce the equilibrium on the fluid--structure interface in cases with strong interaction. This coupling algorithm performs coupling iterations between the solver of the flow equations and the solver of the structural equations. Current coupling algorithms couple one flow solver with one structural solver. Here, a new class of multi-solver quasi-Newton coupling algorithms for unsteady fluid--structure interaction simulations is presented. More than one flow solver and more than one structural solver are used for a single simulation. The numerical experiments demonstrate that the duration of a simulation decreases as the number of solvers is increased. "

    abstract = {{The subiteration method, which forms the basic iterative procedure for solving fluid--structure-interaction problems, is based on a partitioning of the fluid--structure system into a fluidic part and a structural part. In fluid--structure interaction, on short time scales the fluid appears as an added mass to the structural operator, and the stability and convergence properties of the subiteration process depend significantly on the ratio of this apparent added mass to the actual structural mass. In the present paper, we establish that the added-mass effects corresponding to compressible and incompressible flows are fundamentally different. For a model problem, we show that on increasingly small time intervals, the added mass of a compressible flow is proportional to the length of the time interval, whereas the added mass of an incompressible flow approaches a constant. We then consider the implications of this difference in proportionality for the stability and convergence properties of the subiteration process, and for the stability and accuracy of loosely coupled staggered time-integration methods.}},

Arterial walls are modeled by a linearly viscoelastic, cylindrical Koiter shell model capturing both radial and longitudinal displacement. Fluid flow is modeled by the Navier–Stokes equations for an incompressible, viscous fluid. The two are fully coupled via kinematic and dynamic coupling conditions. Our numerical scheme is based on a new modified Lie operator splitting that decouples the fluid and structure sub-problems in a way that leads to a loosely coupled scheme which is unconditionally stable. This was achieved by a clever use of the kinematic coupling condition at the fluid and structure sub-problems, leading to an implicit coupling between the fluid and structure velocities. The proposed scheme is a modification of the recently introduced “kinematically coupled scheme” for which the newly proposed modified Lie splitting significantly increases the accuracy. The performance and accuracy of the scheme were studied on a couple of instructive examples including a comparison with a monolithic scheme. It was shown that the accuracy of our scheme was comparable to that of the monolithic scheme, while our scheme retains all the main advantages of partitioned schemes, such as modularity, simple implementation, and low computational costs.

abstract = "Abstract We present a benchmark problem and a loosely-coupled partitioned scheme for fluid--structure interaction with composite structures. The benchmark problem consists of an incompressible, viscous fluid interacting with a structure composed of two layers: a thin elastic layer with mass which is in contact with the fluid and modeled by the Koiter membrane/shell equations, and a thick elastic layer with mass modeled by the equations of linear elasticity. An efficient, modular, partitioned operator-splitting scheme is proposed to simulate solutions to the coupled, nonlinear \{FSI\} problem, without the need for sub-iterations at every time-step. An energy estimate associated with unconditional stability is derived for the fully nonlinear \{FSI\} problem defined on moving domains. Two instructive numerical benchmark problems are presented to test the performance of numerical \{FSI\} schemes involving composite structures. It is shown numerically that the proposed scheme is at least first-order accurate both in time and space. This work reveals a new physical property of \{FSI\} problems involving thin interfaces with mass: the inertia of the thin fluid--structure interface regularizes solutions to the full \{FSI\} problem.

In particular, we consider \{BDF\} and Newmark time discretization schemes, and we study different methods for the treatment of the fluid--structure interface position, focusing on partitioned algorithms for the prescription of the physical continuity conditions at the fluid--structure interface. We consider semi-implicit and implicit algorithms, and a new family of hybrid methods. We study numerically the performance and the accuracy of these schemes, highlighting the best solutions for haemodynamic applications. We also study numerically their convergence properties with respect to time discretization, by introducing an analytical test case. "

We study some new inexact schemes, obtained from semi-implicit approximations, which treat exactly the physical interface conditions while performing just one or few iterations for the management of the interface position and of the fluid and structure non-linearities. We show that such schemes allow to improve the efficiency while preserving the accuracy of the related exact (implicit) scheme. To do this we consider both a simple analytical test case and two real cases of clinical interest in haemodynamics. We also provide an error analysis for a simple differential model problem when a \{BDF\} method is considered for the time discretization and only few Newton iterations are performed at each temporal instant.

    abstract = {{A methodology for designing formally second-order time-accurate and yet loosely-coupled partitioned procedures for the solution of nonlinear fluid--structure interaction (FSI) problems on moving grids is presented. Its key components are a fluid time-integrator that is provably second-order time-accurate on moving grids, the midpoint rule for advancing in time the solution of the structural dynamics equations of motion, a second-order structure predictor for bypassing the inner-iterations encountered in strongly-coupled solution procedures, and a carefully designed algorithm for time-integrating the motion of the fluid-mesh. Following this methodology, two different loosely-coupled schemes are constructed for the solution of transient nonlinear FSI problems and proved to be second-order time-accurate. Three-dimensional numerical results pertaining to the simulation of the aeroelastic response to a gravity excitation of a complete F-16 configuration are also presented. In addition to confirming the theoretical results discussed in this paper, these numerical results highlight a very stable behavior of the designed loosely-coupled partitioned procedures.}},
