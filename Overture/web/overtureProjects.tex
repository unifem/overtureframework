   The Overture Framework is a large effort and is organized into numerous projects.
Some of these projects are summarized here.


\section {A++/P++ Array Class Library}
% Use this web page location eventually
% \htmladdnormallink{A++P++}{http://www.llnl.gov/casc/\%7EAxxPxx/axxpxx.html}
% \htmladdnormallink{A++P++}{http:/home/dquinlan/public_html/A++P++/axxpxx.html}
  \htmladdnormallink{A++P++}{\projects/AxxPxx/AppPpp/AppPpp.html}
is a serial/parallel array class library used within Overture and made
available separately.

% \section {AMR++ Adaptive Mesh Refinement Class Library}
% % Use this web page location eventually
% % \htmladdnormallink{AMR++}{http://www.llnl.gov/casc/\%7EAMRxx/amrxx.html}
% % \htmladdnormallink{AMR++}{http:/home/dquinlan/public_html/AMR++/amrxx.html}
%   \htmladdnormallink{AMR++}{\projects/AMRxx/AMRxx/AMRxx.html}
% is a part of the Overture framework and is a library which provides abstractions for
% adaptive mesh refinement (AMR).  It requires the Overture library which handles
% the details of overlapping grids, AMR++ provides the additional capability of providing
% adaptive mesh refinement on these overlapping grids.  AMR++ is still in development.

% \section {ROSE Preprocessor Generator}
% % Use this web page location eventually
% % \htmladdnormallink{ROSE}{http://www.llnl.gov/casc/\%7EROSE/rose.html}
% % \htmladdnormallink{ROSE}{http:/home/dquinlan/public_html/ROSE/rose.html}
%   \htmladdnormallink{ROSE}{\projects/ROSE/ROSE/ROSE.html}
% /home/henshaw/webPage/PROJECTS/ROSE/ROSE/ROSE.html
% is a tool for building C++ optimizing preprocessors for object-oriented class 
% library optimization.

% \section {PADRE Library}
% % Use this web page location eventually
% % \htmladdnormallink{PADRE}{http://www.llnl.gov/casc/\%7EPADRE/padre.html}
% % \htmladdnormallink{PADRE}{http:/home/dquinlan/public_html/PADRE/PADRE/PADRE.html}
%   \htmladdnormallink{PADRE}{\projects/PADRE/PADRE/PADRE.html}
% is a library for the distribution of data in a parallel environment and the 
% handling the communication that is required in using the distributed data.
% 
% \section {MLB: Multi-Level Load Balancing Library}
% % Use this web page location eventually
% % \htmladdnormallink{PADRE}{http://www.llnl.gov/casc/MLB/MLB.html}
% % \htmladdnormallink{PADRE}{http:/home/dquinlan/public_html/MLB/MLB/MLB.html}
%   \htmladdnormallink{MLB (Multi-Level Load Balancing)}{\projects/MLB/MLB/MLB.html}
% is a library for the load balancing of structure grids. Since it's interface is relatively abstract
% it is well suited to the load balancing of many grids such as occur in adaptive mesh refinement or
% overlapping grid computations. This work is specialized for structured grids an as such it uses
% methods that take advantage of the geometry.  This is in contrast to graph based
% mechanism which are well suited to the load balancing of unstructured grids.
% MLB addresses the requirement os large number of processors by providing output in the form of
% optimized communication schedules for the redistribution of the load.  MLB is a parallel
% algorithm well suited for dynamic problems and the re-load-balancing of collections
% of grids.  MLB is used within our research on parallel adaptive mesh refinement.
% 
% \section {Benchmark Library}
% % Use this web page location eventually
%   \htmladdnormallink{Benchmark Library}{\projects/Benchmark/Benchmark/Benchmark.html}
% is a library for evaluating the performance of serial and parallel applications and 
% program fragments.  In particular it automates many complex tests that report
% information significant to the evaluation and debugging of performance problems.
% The Benchmark Library provides simple mechanism for testing performance
% both of parallel codes and different versions of a code written in different
% languages (C, FORTRAN, C++, A++, P++).  The tests are not specific to A++/P++
% or any parts of the Overture framework.
% 
% \section {Software Quality Project}
% % Use this web page location eventually
%   \htmladdnormallink{Software Quality Mechanisms}{\projects/SoftwareQuality/SoftwareQuality/SoftwareQuality.html}
% are used in the development of many of the projects within the Overture Framework.
% This work shows how we use commonly available tools, {\bf GNU Autoconf}, {\bf GNU Automake}, and {\bf EXPECT}
% to automate the testing of software across numerous platforms with a multitude of options.  The
% tests are a part of the development and since they can quickly and automatically report portability problems
% they form an effective defense against the infiltration of bugs in our software.

\section{cg: CompositeGrid PDE solvers}

A set of PDE solvers for solving various equations. 

% Includes cgcns, cgins, cgasf, cgmx, cgad, cgmp.

% \htmladdnormallink{OverBlown}{\documentation/obHTML/obHTML.html} is a Navier-Stokes flow solver
% for overlapping grids.

\section{Ogmg: Overlapping Grid Multigrid Solver}

\htmladdnormallink{Ogmg}{\documentation/ogmgHTML/ogmgHTML.html} is a multigrid solver for
overlapping grids.

\section{Mappings}

The \htmladdnormallink{Mapping}{\documentation/mappingHTML/mappingHTML.html} classes define
CAD and grid generation capabilities in Overture.

\section{Hyperbolic Grid Generator}

The \htmladdnormallink{Hyperbolic Grid Generator}{\documentation/hyperbolicHTML/hyperbolicHTML.html} is
a very useful routine for building surface grids and volume grids.

\section{Elliptic Grid Generator}

The elliptic grid generator described in the \htmladdnormallink{Mapping}{\documentation/mappingHTML/mappingHTML.html}
defines elliptic grid generation algorithms for building smooth grids.


\section{Cartesian Embedded Boundary Grid Generation}
  
Based upon the tools from the Rapsodi project (a sub-project of Overture)
the {\bf rap} program can be used together with CART3D to build 
\htmladdnormallink{embedded boundary grids}{\documentation/../APDEC_review_plan/index.html}.

\section{Operators}

The \htmladdnormallink{Operators}{\documentation/opHTML/opHTML.html} classes in Overture define
various flavours of difference approximations and also define a library of boundary conditions.


\section{Ogen: Overlapping Grid Generator}

The  \htmladdnormallink{Overture grid generator}{\documentation/ogenHTML/ogenHTML.html}, ogen,
can be used to construct overlapping grids and unstructured (hybrid) grids.

\section{Oges: Sparse system solver}

The \htmladdnormallink{Overlapping Grid Equation Solver}{\documentation/ogesHTML/ogesHTML.html}
is a class that acts as a front end to a variety of linear equation.

\section{PlotStuff: Overture Plotting Functions}

The \htmladdnormallink{graphical user interface}{\documentation/GraphicsDocHTML/GraphicsDocHTML.html}
for Overture implements routines for plotting grids and
grid functions and building GUI's.
