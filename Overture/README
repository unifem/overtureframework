This is the Overture from the github git repository.

  (0) Make sure that "." is in your path, many Overture and cg scripts assume this.
      For example, for bash, add the following to your .profile

         export PATH=$PATH:.

To build a distribution of Overture:

  (1) Define the environmental variables and $OvertureBuild to be
      the directory where you want to build distribution. For example,

         export Overture=$HOME/Overture.bin
         export OvertureBuild=$Overture
         
  (2) type
  
         ./buildOverture

      This will create the $OvertureBuild directory and copy files into it.
      The buildOverture script will call a 'build' script in each sub-directory
      (for example mapping/build or grid/build) to copy files from that subdirectory into 
       the $OvertureBuild directory.

  (3) Go to the $OvertureBuild directory and run 
  
          ./configure
          make -j2


To make changes to Overture source files:

  (1) Go to the appropriate sub-directory in this directory, such as mapping, grid or gf ...

  (2) Make changes to a file such as mapping/SplineMapping.C
      Test the changes using the appropriate test routine such as mapping/pm.C
      (You may have to edit the mapping/Makefile to compile pm.C with SplineMapping.o)
      
      If you change a header file, such as mapping/Mapping.h you may have to rebuild 
      the Overture distribution, $OvertureBuild. You can type 'build' from
      the mapping directory which will copy all appropriate files from mapping
      into $OvertureBuild. You can then go to $OvertureBuild and type make. You may
      first have to type 'make clean' or 'make cleano' to clean out all .o files.
