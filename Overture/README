This is the Overture from the CVS repository

To build a distribution of Overture:

  (1) Define the environmental variable $OvertureBuild to be
      the directory where you want to build distribution.
      For example,
         setenv OvertureBuild /home/henshaw/Overture.v18

  (2) type 
         buildOverture

      This will create the $OvertureBuild directory and copy files into it.
      The buildOverture script will call a 'build' script in each sub-directory
      (for example mapping/build or grid/build) to copy files from that subdirectory into 
       the $OvertureBuild directory.

  (3) Go to the $OvertureBuild directory and run configure and make.


To make changes to Overture source files:

  (1) Go to the appropriate sub-directory in this directory, such as mapping
     or grid or gf ...

  (2) Make changes to a file such as mapping/SplineMapping.C
      Test the changes using the appropriate test routine such as mapping/pm.C
      (You may have to edit the mapping/Makefile to compile pm.C with SplineMapping.o)
      
      If you change a header file, such as mapping/Mapping.h you may have to rebuild 
      the Overture distribution, $OvertureBuild. You can type 'build' from
      the mapping directory which will copy all appropriate files from mapping
      into $OvertureBuild. You can then go to $OvertureBuild and type make. You may
      first have to type 'make clean' or 'make cleano' to clean out all .o files.
