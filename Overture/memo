Overture.v26 - released August 1, 2015
Changes:

   o *NOTE* You may need to rebuild your overlapping grids and or show files with this new version.
   o *NOTE* Overture now requires the Lapack and Blas libraries (previously only CG required these)
   o *NOTE* For Apple Mac's running Mavericks there are new install instructions since gcc is nolonger
            supported. You will also need to use the latest version of A++/P++ (AP-0.8.2.tar.gz)

   o New ogen grid scripts:
      - loftedShipHullGrid.cmd : grid for a Wigley ship hull.

   o 2012/11/24 - fixed a bug in the Neumann BC with TZ when calling with multiple components. (neumann.C)
   o 2013/08/03 - fixed bugs in ogen and the HyperbolicMapping when building grids on a periodic channel.
   o 2013/09/09 - cgcns, cgins and cgsm now have their own versions of userDefinedInitialConditions.C and
                  userDefinedKnownSolution.C found the cns/src, ins/src and sm/src, respectively) 
                  (instead of using the version found in common/src). 
   o 2013/09/11 - For the explicit hole cutters in Ogen: one can now specify which grids the explicit hole cutter
                  can cut holes in. 
   o 2013/09/27 - The CG solvers (Cgins, Cgcns, Cgsm, Cgmx, Cgasf) now check for grid with negative volumes
                  and abort if any negative volumes are found.
   o 2013/11/22 - fixed the cgins AFS solver so that restarts can be made from a show file that has solutions
                  at a different grid resolution.
   o 2013/11/30 - fixed a bug in Ogmg for singular problems with fourth-order accuracy - these did not converge 
                  well, if at all.
   o 2014/05/18 - added option for setting variable coefficient mixed boundary conditions with applyBoundaryConditions
                  such as a0(x,y,z)*u + a1(x,y,z)*u.n = g(x). See the example in tbc.C and tbcc.C
   o 2014/05/30 - changes were made so that Overture can be built on the Mac OS X 10.9 (Mavericks) which has new compilers.
   o 2014/05/31 - changes were made so that PETSc can be called from the Mac. The main program should now call INIT_PETSC_SOLVER();
   o 2014/06/02 - dues to changes for the Mac one now needs to always link to the multigrid library libOgmg in Overture/lib
   o 2014/06/02 - fixed a bug with some of the OGPolyFunction (twilight-zone) functions that fill in array values. Some
                  time derivatives where not computed properly. 
   o 2014/06/24 - Fixed a bug in the block Tridiagonal solver -- the transpose of the blocks were being used. 
   o 2014/06/24 - There is a new cg/unitTests directory that has test routines for some of the stand-alone classes such
                  as the BeamModel class. 
   o 2014/08/06 - an initial version of a parallel tridiagonal solver has been added to the TridiagonalSolver class,
                  for tridiagonal and block tridiagonal systems (not yet for penta-diagonal). This version is
                  not particularly scalable. 
   o 2014/08/17 - The DataPointMapping now has an option to be evaluated underneath with a NurbsMapping - this
                  allows higher order accurate representations of the mapping.
   o 2014/12/31 - bug fixed with hyperbolic grid generator - "match to mapping" boundary condition was broken
                  when mapping was a side of an existing grid.
   o 2015/03/27 - the userDefinedBoundaryValue routines have been changed a bit. There are now separate versions for
                  each of the CG solvers -- Cgins, Cgcns, Cgad, etc.
   o 2015/05/19 - Cgmx: added user defined known solution; fixed external forcing with modified equation 
                  time-stepping to be fourth-order accurate.
   o 2015/05    - Cgmx is now compiled by default when typing "make" in the main cg directory.
   o 2015/05    - Cg solvers now always link to the Ogmg multigrid solver (no need to set useOgmg := on). 

==============================================================================================
Overture.v25 - released  November 21, 2012
Changes:

   o The following documentation has been significantly updated:
         Cgins User Guide.
         Cgins Reference Manual.
         Ogen User Guide.
         Cgmx User Guide. 

   o New ogen grid scripts:
      - loftedBox, loftedHalfBox: grid for a "cube" or "half-cube" using the LoftedSurfaceMapping.
      - flatPlateWingGrid.cmd : grid for a 3D flat-plate wing. 
      - wingj.cmd : grid for 3D wing from Joukoswky airofil cross-sections.
      - loftedJoukowskyFlatTip : grid for twisted 3D Joukowsky wing with a flattened tip.
      - cylinderInAChannel.cmd : 3D cylinder in a channel.
      - pump2dGrid.cmd : grid for a 2D centrifugal pump.
      - flattenedTorusGrid.cmd : grid for a 3D "ring" (flattened torus). 
      - pillInABoxGrid.cmd : grid for a "pill" (3D disk) in a box.

   o 110605 - bug fixed in NurbsMappings when interpolating a NurbsMapping from another mapping
              and specifying "number of ghost points to include". This option was broken for
              surfaces and 3D volumes.
   o 110624 - added an option to 3d contour plotter to base the colour table min/max values on
              the min/max values of the solutions on the contour and coordinate planes, rather
              than the global min/max.
   o 110628 - fixed parallel grid plotter to plot interpolation points.
   o 110713 - fixed a bug with AMR and moving grids. In rare cases, values on exposed points may
              not have been assigned properly. 
   o 110727 - fixed the moving grid generator so the vertex array is no longer built on Cartesian grids.
              This will save memory for cgcns and cgins with moving grids.
   o 110731 - fixed a bug in the SweepMapping in the way it computes the normal to the sweep surface.
              If you have previously made a grid with the SweepMapping and it
              no longer works you may need to set the 'orientation' to be -1 to change the direction
              of the normal to the Sweep surface.
   o 110806 - fixed two bugs in the hyperbolic grid generator: when marching in both directions the
              forward direction needed to march one more line, and the stretching was wrong in the
              backward direction. 
   o 110817 - there is now an option in the grid plotter to save the composite grid to a file. This
              grid can then, for example, be read back into ogen and changed or regenerated.
   o 110828 - it should now be possible to use a hyperbolic grid (or DataPointMapping) for parallel
              computations with cgins or cgcns. Previously I recommended that these mappings be
              converted to Nurbs. The Nurbs mapping currently will use more memory in parallel
              as all control points are duplicated on each processor. 
   o 110828 - fixed a bug in the parallel line smoother for Ogmg.
   o 111207 - There is a new option for saving hard copies. If the file name extension is ".pdf" as
              in "myPlot.pdf" then a pdf output file will be created (using a system call to the 'convert'
              program which is assumed to exist on your machine.)
   o 111210 - There was a bug in the Integrate class if volume integrals were computed for an overlapping
              grid before any surface integrals.
   o 111210 - The default behaviour of getFromADataBase has changed -- the input "fileName" argument
              now has a return value equal to the full path name of the grid file that was found.
   o 111211 - There is now an option when generating an overlapping grid to compute and save the 
              integration weights in the same file. These weights can be read by cgins, for example,
              when running rigid body simulations (and thus the weights do not need to be recomputed).  
              This option is especially useful in parallel since the weights can be pre-computed in serial.
              (Computation of the weights in parallel currently may not work in all cases due to a 
               problem with PETSc.)
   o 120317 - Fixed a bug in ogen when checkOverlappingGrid would detect an invalid interpolation point even
              though ogen did not detect it -- could occur when multiple shared surfaces were located in the
              same area.
   o 120325 - There is a new option in Ogen to define explicit hole cutters. These may be needed in some
              cases when the physical boundary is not very well defined (see the Ogen documentation). 
   o 120422 - Fixed some bugs in Ogen related to shared sides which could have caused grids to be made
              with backup points where there shouldn't have been any, or could have resulted in grids
              that failed the final checking step.
   o 120422 - Fixed some problems related to generating grids on CAD for high-order accurate methods that
              require 2 or more ghost points to lie on the surface (see the hyperbolic and ogen documentation
              for the correct way to do this).
   o 120501 - When interactively specifying the number of grid lines for a Mapping, a value of -1 now means keep
              the current number of grid lines in that direction.
   o 120601 - The "query a grid point" option from the grid plotter now works in parallel.
   o 120601 - Fixed plotting in parallel of derived functions that require derivatives, such as vorticity, enstrophy etc.
   o 120604 - Fixed some problems with the parallel coarse grid generation in the multigrid solver Ogmg.
   o 120703 - The parallel interpolator now works with implicit interpolation so that CG solvers can be run
              in parallel using grids generated with implicit interpolation. This is more expensive since the
              equations are solved by a simple iteration and you should normally set the maximum number of
              interations in CG command files to a value of 10 (or less):
                    maximum number of iterations for implicit interpolation
                       10
   o 120914 - the Cgins inflow boundary condition inflowWithPressureAndTangentialVelocityGiven now works in
              parallel and for fourth-order (for fourth-order one may need to avoid projecting the initial
              conditions for now)
   o 121921 - Kyle's nice in-memory "data-base" class DBase has been moved from cg into Overture so that Overture
              classes can also use it. This is a very useful class.
   o 121023 - The Overture check.p script now works with the parallel version.
   o 121023 - the perl script Overture/bin/perlcmd can be used to substitute and replace all perl commands from 
              an Overture or CG command file and turn it into a new command file that does not require perl.
              This may be useful if you want to run on a machine where embedded perl commands do not work for
              some reason.
                # Example:
                #  To remove perl from the ogen script cicArg.cmd use:
                #     perlcmd cicNoPerl.cmd cicArg.cmd -order=2 -factor=1
                #  Now ogen can be run without using the perl parser:
                #     ogen -noplot cicNoPerl.cmd

==============================================================================================
Overture.v24
Changes:
   NOTE: Due to a bug fix in the HDF file output (100329 below) you will need to regenerate your grids and showfiles
         for this new version.

   o there is a new graphics option, "set home", (in the command window "File menu") that will make the 
              current view the "home" view. The home view is the one that appears when using the "reset" 
              command (the button with the "home" on it). The "reset" button (command GLOB:init view) 
              will return the home view to the default.
   o 090422 : fixed a bug in ogen that mainly applied to multi-domain grids -- sometimes interpolation
              was allowed between grids from different domains. (classify.C l.2615)
   o 090423 : added a check to mogl.C for NumLock being on -- a message is printed if it is.
              You should turn off NumLock since the mouse buttons won't work properly.
   o 090429 : fixed a bug in CompositeGrid.C for grids saved from parallel ogen, some of the 
              interpolation info was not saved correctly (convertLocalInterpolationData).
   o 090529 : fixed plotting of sequences in plotStuff with multi-domain problems. The sequences to plot
              now appear on the main dialog.
   o 090530 : NOTE: running remotely with the gnome window manager can be slow when running command files
              interactively, (not sure why?), KDE seems less likely to have this problem. See note below 090809. 
   o 090531 : fixed a problem with rubber-band zooming (with middle mouse button) with
              extreme zooms (e.g. for fixing trim curves) and picking objects -- this works better now. 
   o 090628 : contour2d, when picking values with the mouse, hidden grids will not be used.
   o 090705 : now when a moving grid computation fails with an invalid grid, the program enters
              the normal interactive update mode of Ogen so you can remake/query the grid (before the
              program entered some funny update mode that was confusing). 
   o 090705 : fixed bug with moving grids, the bounding box was not always computed correctly which
              led to ogen failing when it should have worked (this bug was caused by some code added for parallel).
   o 090804 : fixed a bug in the ogen's moving grid algorithm: the mask on ghost points was not always set
              correctly (the problem occurs when a grid "slides" along a shared boundary).
   o 090808 : there are new parallel copy routines to copy a serial array from one processor to another, see
              ParallelUtility.h and CopyArray.bC
   o 090809 : there is a new option for the .overturerc file:
                showCommandHistory: 1    # set to 0 if interactive scripts are slow to display
              Sometimes running scripts interactively is very slow when running over a network and
              this may be fixed by setting this option to '0'. 
   o 090913 : The new plot option 'set plot bounds' (from the grid or contour plotter) allows one to 
              set fixed bounds on x, y and z. Useful when the grid deforms and changes size. 
              Use 'reset plot bounds' to turn off.
   o 091127 : The new InterpolatePointsOnAGrid class can be used to interpolate a set of points in space
              from a composite grid function. This functionality works in parallel and supports higher order
              interpolation. It replaces the old InterpolatePoints class and even older interpolatePoints function.
   o 091127 : The ExposedPoints class now works in parallel (used to interpolate points that become "exposed"
              during a moving grid computation).
   o 091127 : Fixed some bugs for the parallel version of "extrapolate interpolation neighbours" that is used
              to assign values to unused points next to interpolation points (allowing a wider stencil to be used).
   o 091209 : there are new parallel copy functions in the CopyArray class for copying serial arrays into a 
              single distributed array (see ParallelUtility.h and CopyArray.bC). This is more general than
              the normal P++ copy since the serial arrays can be arbitrarily distributed. 
   o 091209 : There are a variety of new grid generation examples in the sampleGrids directory including: 
                 cubeInABox.cmd, slider.cmd, squareHole.cmd, sphere.cmd, rotatedBoxBesideBox.cmd 
                 valveArg.cmd, plateWithHoles.cmd, plate3dWithHoles.cmd wing3d.cmd, backStepSmooth3d.cmd,
                 divot.cmd, afm.cmd, lens.cmd, solidSphereInABox.cmd 
   o 100226 : The Integrate class should now work in parallel. 
   o 100309 : There is a new LoftedSurfaceMapping that can be used to define a lofted surface such as the
              surface of a wing with a tip. This mapping was used to build some of the surfaces for 
              the overlapping grid for the model wind-turbine with tower and nacelle.
   o 100329 : Bug fixed in the HDF file output of parallel distributed arrays when using the multiple file output
              option (which is the default). Space was being allocated in the main hdf file for the whole array 
              even though no data was written there. This meant that the main hdf file was huge when it
              should not have been. Thanks to Jeff Banks for noticing this. 
  o 100424  : In cleaning up the MappedGrid the "min and max edge length" arrays were removed since these are
              rarely used. 
  o 100722  : There is a new "exponential to linear" stretching option which might be a good choice for
              clustering grid points near boundaries. This function can be used to create very small grid
              cells near boundaries if desired. 
  o 110211  : There are two new functions in showFileFromDataFile.C that can be used to read and write a 
              grid and solution from an 'ovText' data file. Use 'plotStuff -ovText' to read in a grid and
              solution from an "ovText" data file (choose the menu item 'data file format' to
              display the format of the file). From the plotStuff menu use 'save ovText file' to save 
              a grid and solution from a show file into an ovText data file. This is a good way to 
              import a grid and solution into Overture. The solution can subsequently be used as initial conditions 
              for one of the CG solvers, for example. This format is better than the plot3d format since it 
              has more information about boundary conditions, ghost points etc.
  o 110515  : There is a new "transferSolution" program in Overture/bin that can be used to interpolate a
              solution from one overlapping grid to another overlapping grid (e.g. a finer grid, or a grid
              on a larger or smaller domain.). The program reads a solution from a "source" show file and outputs the
              results to a new "target" show file.
  o 110515  : Some improvements have been made for reading and writing plot3d files. There is a new   
              option "save plot3d file" in the plotStuff menu that allows one to save a solution and grid
              into plot3d files (these could then be shown in another graphics program for e.g.). 
              plotStuff can read plot3d grid and solution ("q" or "f") files using the
              command "plotStuff -plot3d".

==============================================================================================
Overture.v23 - released approx. March 13, 2009
  To do:
    Mixed derivatives: variable a0, a1, a2

Changes:

   o NOTE: Comments in command files can now begin with # or * 

   o The new version of A++/P++ supports arrays that can have 2^63 = 9e18 elements, the previous version was 
     limited to 2^31 = 2e9 elements. 

   o ** Data base files now contain the Overture version number they were created with. If you are unable
     to read an old file with a newer version of Overture, Overture will tell you which older version to use.
   o fixed bug in plotting sequences in the show file.
   o fixed a bug in Oges -- the initial guess for iterative solvers was not being assigned properly
     for the case of systems of equations.
   o there is a new example in Overture/primer/gridPrint.C that reads a grid from a data base and
     outputs the grid information to a plain text file. 
   o commands generated by perl in command files can now contain a comment line (starting with a '*' or '#')
   o the 2d contour plotter now has an option for flat-shading (toggle button) where the colour of each
     grid cell is constant (based on the average values at the 4 vertices)
   o fixed a bug in ogen that caused the hole-cutting to fail in some special cases in 2D 
     (cutHolesNew.bC, line 2241)
   o fixed the hyperbolic grid generator so that it handles start curves that are "derivative" periodic
   o fixed a bug in Oges.C for predefined equations with mixed-BC's in which sometimes the system was 
     wrongly thought to be singular.
   o fixed a bug in ReductionMapping.C -- the inverseMap was not correct.
   o fixed a bug in the mixed/aDotGradu/generalized-mixed BC on curvilinear grids -- a matrix was built 
     and saved to hold the BC but this matrix was not updated if the coefficents of the mixed BC changed.
   o the option was added to the grid plotter to colour grids by domain number (for multi-domain grids)
   o there is a coefficient matrix example in tests/tcmge.C, that shows how to fill in arbitrary equations.
   o there is a new displayCoeff function to display elements in a coefficient matrix in a nice way. 
   o the new version of Ogen can be used to generate grids in parallel for many cases (some hard cases
     that require backup interpolation will not work yet). 

==============================================================================================
Overture.v22
  To do:
    Mixed derivatives: variable a0, a1, a2
    Split up assignBoundaryConditions.f (for Kyle)

Changes:

   o There is a new version of the data base interface for HDF5. This will support parallel I/O.
     No changes should be required to your code, but you will need to install hdf5 before building Overture.
     The HDF4 version should still work, although eventually we may stop supporting it.
     If you move to HDF5 then you will need to re-create all grids and show files, since the formats
     are not compatible.

   o the sample program amrHype.C has been renamed amrh.C -- this program has been improved upon as
     a test of parallel or serial AMR.

   o The LoadBalancer and GridDistribution classes have been added for parallel load balancing. 
     See the example use in pwave.C and amrh.C

   o There is a new perl script Overture/check.p that can be used to run a series of regressions tests.

   o The definition of the vectorSymmetry boundary condition for coefficient matrices has been
     changed to ensure that there is a diagonal element in the matrix. 

   o There is a new plotting function "displacement" for plotting results from solid mechanics applications
     where the computed solution represents the displacement of the grid points.

   o There have been many changes to support parallel computations. These include changes
     to the AMR routines. 

   o The grid generator Ogen has been optimised to use less memory -- for Cartesian grids the
     array of verticies is nolonger built at all. 

   o I have added the new operator divergenceTensorGradient that approximates div( K grad ) u 
     where K is a NxN tensor in N=1,2,3 space dimensions. This operator has been
     implemented using conservative (symmetric) and non-conservative approximations to orders
     of accuracy  2,4,6, and 8.
     It is only available through the optimized interface (function MappedGridOperators::derivative).

  o the divergence operator (obtained through the optimized interface) is now available
    for conservative and non-conservative for orders 2,4,6,8

  o The NurbsMapping has a new option to turn a 3d curve into a 2d curve by projecting onto a plane

  o The files interpolatePoints.{h,C} were changed to interpPoints.{h,C}  (OSX fix)
  o The files Triangle.{h,C} were changed to TriangleClass.{h,C}  (OSX fix)
  o Renames oges.C to ogesFiles.C  (OSX fix)
  o Removed fileOuptut.h --> use FileOutput.h instead.  (OSX fix)
  o Renamed boxlib/List.H to BL_List.H and boxlib/Assert.H to BL_Assert.H (OSX fix)
  o Removed Display.{h,C} (OSX fix)

  o The FiniteVolumeOperators files are no longer distributed. Use the conservative finite 
    difference operators instead.

  o 3D contour: added "pick to query a grid point" to query values of a solution in 3D.
  o 3D grid plotter: added "pick to add coordinate plane <dir>" to plot grid lines on a coordinate   
     plane.  

  o There is a new function userDefinedOutput (in Overture/Ogshow/userDefinedOutput.C) that can
    be called from plotStuff and contour with the option "user defined output". This function can
    be changed by a user and used, for example, to output results from the current solution into
    a text file. The initial implementation shows how to save the results of a contour-cut when the
    solution is determined on a line or curve that cuts through the domain.

  o The NurbsMapping function to interpolate another Mapping now has the option to interpolate ghost
    points from the source Mapping (to ensure the NurbsMapping has the same ghost points). 

  o There is a new configure option "debug" to force all files to be compiled with debugging on.

  o Kyle added to the option to show files to save multiple frame series (used for multi-physics 
    applications to save different variables in different parts of the domains).

  o A new option added to use block matrices when using Oges to solve equations with PETSc. This is
    useful when solving systems of equations since the diagonal block will be inverted with pvioting.

  o Some memory checking functions have been added to Overture to check the current memory being
    used and the maximum used, see OvertureInit.h.

  o There is a new graphics option "turn off graphics" to skip grid/contour/streamline etc. plotting.
    This is useful in batch mode (and in parallel to avoid building a single processor copy of
    the grid/grid-function). Use "turn on graphics" to reset. The corresponding command line 
    argument is -nographics. Note that the command line option -noplot will itself not turn 
    off all graphics as the grid/contour/streamline plotters will be still be called. 

  o The default number of ghost lines for Ogen is now 2.

  o The GenericDataBase/HDF_DataBase class now has separate calls for saving/reading distributed
    arrays -- getDistributed and putDistributed. This allows the data base to distinguish between
    serial and distributed arrays even when compiled in serial.

  o There is a new parallel read/write mode in the hdf5 implementation of HDF5_DataBase.{h,C}. Different
    processors will now write distributed array data to local serial files. This avoid problems using
    HDF5's parallel IO. These extra files are treated in a transparent way to the user. 

  o The AnnulusMapping can now define an elliptical annulus.

  o The grid generator ogen can now build many types of grids in parallel. 

  o The parallel plotting routines for plotting grids and contours have been changed to avoid copying
    all the data to a single processor. This permits the plotting of larger problems. 


================================================================================================
050623 Overture.v21 
   o added the option when building triangulations inside the "topology" routine
     to specify (approximately) the maximum area of triangles. 

   o added entity 104, conic arc to the iges reader and added a conic arc to the
     NurbsMapping.
   o added the ability to build a general cylinder (i.e. IGES tabulated cylinder) as a NurbsMapping
     by extruding a 3D curve along a line

   o added the option 
         "resolution factor for triangulations" 
     to the "create mappings" menu to adjust the number of triangles that are generated
     on TrimmedMappings when they are plotted -- this can be used to speed up the plotting
     of CAD geometries with very many patches.

   o fixed the NurbsMapping to properly handle un-clamped Nurbs which can appear in some IGES files.
   o added a picking option "refine plot" to the CompositeSurface update function to allow one to increase the
     resolution of surfaces so that they are plotted with more grid points (or a finer triangulation)

   o added a new ReorientMapping that is used by the ReparameterizationTransform to reorder
     the domain (parameter space) coordinates. For example change a Mapping x(r,s) to x(s,r) 
   o changed the NurbsMapping to represent domains in 2D in addition to curves in 2D. You can 
     use the interpolation option to convert any 2D mapping into a NurbsMapping.
   o fixed a problem with SmoothedPolygonMapping to improve the accuracy of the derivatives by 
     adjusting the number of spline points that are used to approximate the smoothed polygon.

   o added an option to the smooth polygon, "correct corners" to automatically adjust the
     corners. This will cause the direction of the ends to match the normals to the polygon (i.e. not
     the normals to the smoothed polygon which may be different).

   o added new functions getToggleValue and getTextValue to the DailogData. These can be used
     to parse an answer and look for changes to toggle states or text values. These can be used
     to shorten a code that checks an answer from a Dialog.

   o added a function insideOrOutside to the CompositeSurface and UnstructuredMapping that uses
     ray-casting to determine if points are inside a triangulation (assumed to be water-tight).

   o fixed the topology to handle the case when a patch is singular on two opposite ends; before
     only one singular side was considered.

   o added a userDerivedDefinedFunction.C that allows one to define new derived types for plotting
     with plotStuff. There are many predefined derived types such as vorticity but sometimes one wants
     to see some other variable. 

   o the plotPoints function can now be used to plot spheres with different colours and different radii.

   o The OverBlown initial condition and boundary condition menus have been updated, the new dialog versions
     are now functional.

   o fixed a problem in CrossSectionMapping get/put functions that prevented reading back from a data-base file.

   o there is a new primer example, deform.C that shows how to treat a cylinder whose shape deforms over time.

   o plotStuff has a new option -plot3d to read in a plot3d solution file and plot it -- this option is still
     in a testing phase

Some Ogshow files need to use -I$(OV_PERL_INCLUDE)
*********************************************************************************************

0208*** Overture.v20

   o changed periodic check in IntersectionMapping.C -- determining whether the curves
      of intersection are periodic should be more robust.
   o added sub.cmd and filletTwoCyl.cmd to ogen checks
   o Can now type `x+r 45' instead of `x+r:0 45' (default window is the current window)
   o Can set the individual colour of each grid.
   o Changed the meaning of the argument levelToInterpolate in InterpolateRefinements::interpolateCoarseFromFine
     to be more meaningful. This could break code that currently uses it. (Using the default value allLevels
     will still work fine)
   o fixed various problems with the hyperbolic grid generator, especially for growing surface grids
     on CAD surfaces. More robust marching across a surface that has a sharp bend (discontinuous normal).
     - Normal blending is chosen automatically for surface grids based on the angle between the
       start curve and boundary curves -- this value is only a guess.
     - Fixed hype so that it does not crash if there is a grid point that cannot be projected
       onto the triangulation
   o new function in DialogData to set the toggle state by label so you don't have to remember the number:
       int setToggleState(const aString & toggleButtonLabel, int trueFalse);  
   o new configure option 'insure' : use this to build a version with insure.
   o New option in GraphicsParameters to turn on/off the plotting of Nurbs curves as sub-curves.
   o Changed plotCompositeSurface so that the colour of surfaces is taken from cs.getColour(s) but
     the colours for volume-grids stored in a CS are done in the same way as for single volume grids.
   o Fixed problems in MappingBuilder w.r.t. hiding grids, colouring boundaries by BC or share etc.
   o fixed a problem when plotting MG levels for rectangular grids -- scaled wrong
   o 021006 fixed a problem with ogmg for auto generation of levels with periodic grids (stir.mg.hdf)
   o changed selection so that when a ID appears twice in the selection the z-buffers values returned
     are the min and max over all selctions with that ID.
     choosen (as opposed to the first occurence).
   o allowed the picking selection buffer to grow even larger 
   o Ogmg: fixed line smoothers to work with constant coefficient pre-defined equations.
         : default line smoother is now under-relaxed Jacobi which is faster in practice than Zebra.
   o fixed a problem calling the optimised divScalarGrad operator.
   o optimised the tbcc.C test routine -- now 10X faster
   o optimised InterpolatePoints and interpolateExposedPoints
   o fixed a bug that interpolation points could would not be plotted in plotStuff when a solution was plotted first.
   o optimised the boundaryDistance function for computing the distance of all grid points to solid walls.
   o reworked contour plotter menu: created a dialog and added an option to hide grids by picking.
   o added "abortOnEnd" option when running the check.p, heal.p and generate.p regression tests so that test
     scripts do not hang waiting for input.
   o added an option to the grid plotter to set the colour of grids on a given refinement level and base grid.
   o changed output format options to "8bit" and "24bit" from "8 bit" and "24 bit" since the command parser 
     does not like a space.
   o added openGUI() call to GL_GraphicsInterface::stopReadingCommandFile() so that the GUI is opened whenever
     the command file ends and the graphics window is open.
   o Added option to hype for smoothing surface grids. 
   o Negative volumes generated by hype are now highlighted in red.
   o Added option to hype and MappingBuilder to specify the desired grid spacing -- this is used when initially
     determining the number of grid points for the starting curve and for marching.
   o Added a "frame" behind the colour bar and titles so that they always appears on top of the plot.
   o 021109 : added a new contour "line plot" option to plot the solution along a curve such as the
       boundary of a grid or any curve defined by the user.
   o Re-organised and added new options to "hype". There are now options for "post" stretching of the 
     grid lines -- i.e. stretching the grid after it has been generated with the marching algorithm.
     There is a new dialog for specifying properties of the stretching that is performed while the grid is
     geneated -- one can, for example, specify the initial grid spacing and have the distance to march be
     automatically computed from the number of grid lines.
   o IgesReader: added a check to see if the IGES file contains line feeds ^M instead of new lines. The line feeds 
     cause problems and can be removed with dos2unix, for example.
   o hype: I have added an option so that you can query a point on the screen and determine the location
      of the point with respect to the current grid, starting curve and reference surface. This can be used for
      example to determine where to stretch points.
   o hype: fixed a problem generating surface grids where the marching direction was not chosen 
     properly on a start curve. This should fix Kyle's bug and also some problems Anders was having 
   o hype: added "print grid statistics" to display data about the grid spacing and cell volumes.
   o IntersectionMapping: fixed a problem with intersect curves not converging when the curve had a sharp corner.
   o MappingBuilder: One can now create a curve on a CAD surface by intersecting a plane with the surface.
     The plane will be intersected with each trimmed-patched and the resulting segments joined together to
     form a single curve.
   o MappingBuilder: TFI grids created with 'build surface patch' can now be stretched and smoothed
   o MappingBuilder: box grids built with `build box grid' can now be stretched.
   o 021121: fixed a problem with 3D streamlines not being properly removed.
   o added an option to the grid plotter to hide grids by picking and to set the colour of grids by picking
   o added OptionMenu::setCurrentChoice(const aString & label) so you can set the current choice by the label
     instead of a number
   o added a function to call in BoundaryConditionParameters so that all points on mixed boundaries are assigned in
    boundary conditions.  Boundary conditions on mixed boundaries are normally NOT assigned at 
     points on the boundary that are actually interpolation or interior points (like a C-grid).
   o fixed a a bug in the operators finish boundary conditions for coefficients matrices when the grid was
     periodic along axis2 the extrapolation equations were not added
   o fixed a bug with the matrix transform -- the coordinate singularity of the un-transformed mapping was
     not transfered to the transformed mapping. One can now rotate a sphere and then use the orthographic projection.
   o fixed bug in ogen for 3d grids, when holecutting the distance to the boundary was not computed correctly so that
     specifying a maximum hole cutting distance did not work.
   o added an option to the grid plotter to toggle off selected boundaries of grids using the mouse.
   o MappedGridOperators: added a 4th order conservative and symmetric approximation for the 
     laplace and divScalarGrad operators.
--- cvs commit 030121 ---
   o grid plotter: added the option to set the colour of individual grid `boundaries' and to choose the
      colour using the mouse.
   o added optimized overlapping interpolation for interpolation widths of 4-9 (used by higher order methods)
     and fixed a bug in implicit interpolation for width>5.
   o reworked the optimised overlapping-grid interpolation so that the coefficients of the interpolation
     formula are NOT precomputed and stored. Instead the coefficients are computed (mainly) when a function
     is interpolated. This saves storage (which can be substantial for a 3d higher-order interpolant) and
     runs faster. A 3d sixth-order example ran 5 times faster with setup-time 100 times faster.
   o I have added sixth and 8th order versions of all the standard "forward" derivative operators including
     high order versions of the conservative laplacian and divScalarGrad operators.
   o I have added a function to the DialogData to set the sensitivity for a widget with a given label.
   o I have reworked the interface for stretching grid lines on mappings (option `stretch coordinates' from
     the `create mappings' menu or the StretchTransform::update function). The new interface should be much
     easier to use. One can now specify the desired minimum grid spacing and location of the stretching.
     The correct values for the parameters will automatically be computed to achieve this grid spacing. 
     This works for the inverse-tanh, tanh and exponential stretching types. One can also plot the stretching
     function, it's derivative and the ratio of adjacent grid spacings in order to see the quality of the
     stretching.
   o added the cvs directories Overture/hype/cmd/slac and Overture/hype/cmd/truck
--- cvs commit 030220? ---
   o added option to toggle grid lines on the individual boundaries of grids in 3D
   o added platform=intel.d.gcc.ifc to testDistribution which uses the Intel fortran compiler (used by
     some of our users -- ifc has a limit of 99 continuation lines which I have a habit of exceeding)
   o The TridiagonalSolver class can now solve systems of penta-diagonal matricies (including the
     case of periodic and "extended" boundary conditions). These appear with fourth-order approximations.
     Block penta-diagonal systems have NOT been implemented yet.
   o added the "coarsening factor" option to 2d contour plotter to allow contours on fine grids to be
     plotted at a lower resolution. Setting this coarsening-factor to "2", for example, will cause the
     contour to use every other grid point (except near boundaries or interpolation points). Setting the
     value to "-2" will cause the contour plotter to use every other grid point only when the colour
     is uniform thus resulting the same looking contour plot as when the fine grid is used everywhere.
   o The command files being saved in Overture are now flushed after every write to the file.
   o Fixed some reference counting bugs in NormalMapping.C and RevolutionMapping.C
   o Fixed a bug in specifying derivative BC's for the spline mapping
   o fixed a reference counting bug in the SweepMapping
   o fixed a problem in finishBoundaryConditions -- update of corner points in 3D was not done in the correct order
   o I've enhanced the 3D contour plotter so that one can add and delete contour-planes, contour-surfaces and 
     boundary-surfaces by clicking with the mouse.
   o I've added some new options for setting the corner ghost points when finishBoundaryConditions is called.
     There are evenSymmetryCorner, oddSymmetryCorner, taylor2ndOrderEvenCorner, taylor4thOrderEvenCorner
     The taylor BC's are accurate to 2nd and 4th order for general functions but reduce to a even symmetry
     condition for even functions. This is often a useful property for Neumann boundary conditions.
   o I added the ability to plot the first and second derivatives of NURBS and spline curves.
   o I added the new primer example, gridGenExample.C, which shows how to create an overlapping grid directly
     in a program, rather than interactively.
   o There is a *new* option in Oges which allows one to only solve on a sub-set of the grids. See the
     Oges function setGridsToUse. Previously one would have to solve on all grids with the identity 
     operator defined on in-active grids.
   o fixed some bugs in compositeTopology related to periodic trimming curves. Fixed some memory leaks
     in DialogData.
   o I added a "print grid statistics" option to the grid plotter.
   o I added an optimised version of the map and inverseMap for the fourth-order accurate version of the
     DataPointMapping.
   o It is now possible to read a command file from within another command file. Use the "read command file"
     command or the new "include fileName.cmd" command.
   o I have added the ability to embed perl statements into Overture command files. Any statement containing
     a semi-colon, such as "$nx=2*11;", is treated as a perl statement. Any subsquent line containing "$nx"
     (but no ";") will have "$nx" replaced by its value, "22". See the description in the GraphicsDoc document
     for some examples.

020801

  o New files:
       op/fortranDeriv/assignBoundaryConditions.f
       op/fortranDeriv/findInterpolationNeighbours.f
  o optimised Neumann BC, periodic BC and fixBoundaryCorners
  o improved the accuracy of getCPU() for Linux from milli to micro-seconds

  o added Overture::abort() and options for setting the action to take when aborting.

     enum AbortEnum
     {
       abortOnAbort,
       throwErrorOnAbort
     };
     static AbortEnum getAbortOption();
     static void setAbortOption( AbortEnum action );
     static void abort();
     static void abort(aString message);



020701:
   o I have changed which machines/compilers are tested with testDistribution.
     I have added the SGI (riptide) but haven't got the script to work yet -- for some
     reason I can set up the path to find the compilers properly.

   o the configure script will automatically look for the pgf77 compilers.

   o There is no need to build or link to libGLw since I now compile these files in Overture/static
     if libGLw is not found.

   o added "nopause" option to turn off stopping at a pause, gi.setIgnorePause(true/false);
   o added a function to abort the program if we stop reading a command file,
          gi.abortIfCommandFileEnds(bool trueOrFalse=true);
     This can be used in test scripts to prevent a code from hanging while waiting for input.

   o I changed getGraphicsInterface to recognise the command line arguments noplot, nopause and abortOnEnd
     (Anders: I changed rap.C to use this). Here is an example from mbuilder:

       // Note: options "noplot", "nopause" and "abortOnEnd" are handled in the next call:
       GenericGraphicsInterface & gi = *Overture::getGraphicsInterface("mbuilder",false,argc,argv);

   o add some new tests to testDistribution in sampleGrids/gridsFromCad.p
   o optimised plotUnstructured.C

   o added infoLevel for selecting what information to output. 
             infoLevel: 0=expert, 1=intermediate, 2=novice
     New functions in GenericGraphicsInterface:
         setInfoLevel(int level)
         int getInfoLevel()
         outputString(message, int messageLevel ) : print message if messageLevel <= infoLevel

     Thus if you want to output a message only to novice users you should use messageLevel=2;
     a message to novice and intermediate users use messageLevel=1; a message to all users messageLevel=0

   o added 'wire frame rotation' toggle button to the pulldown Options menu so you can
    toggle on and off the use of a "wire frame" model when rotating.
   


020410:
  o In order to have the Makefile's in the CVS tree work on multiple machines I have
     followed Petri's suggestion and added a new config directory that holds a Makefile.sun 
     and Makefile.intel -- these are included into gf/Makefile, for example, so that one can develop
     code on either the sun or linux box. Not all Makefile's have been changed and the Makefile.intel
     has not been tested

  o Removed many files from the gf directory (see list below), these were moved to the new op directory.
     You will probably need to delete all these files or else "cvs update" will complain.

  o Added the op directory and subdirectories (holds the operators)
    Many new optimized fortran operators have been created. Type
             cvs checkout Overture/op
    from the directory above your Overture directory.
    
  o Added the doc directory: type 
             cvs checkout Overture/doc

  o Added the bpp directory: Holds the bpp preprocessor. You'll need to add bpp to your path
    WARNING: Some .f and .C files are generated using bpp from the files with the same name but
       extensions .bf or .bC. You should fix bugs in the .bf or .bC file. The first line of a bpp
       generated file will say that it was automatically generated. Example: ogshow/grid3d.bC generates
       the file ogshow/grid3d.C
       Type
              cvs checkout Overture/bpp

  o New optimized plotting for rectangular grids: plotting grids/contours no longer requires
     the creation of the array of vertices - look for problems

  o New optimized fortran version of polynomial twilight zone functions supporting more general polynomials
   with higher degrees, needed for testing 6th order methods.

  o Added new tests to testDistribution -- testing all the new operators, coefficient matrices, boundary
      conditions and tcm3. I also created the Checker.{h,C} classes and a smartDiff.p (smart "diff") program
      for help in testing -- see their use in op/tests/tderivatives.C and op/tests/checkop.p

  o I added a "noplot" option to "testDistribution" to run the rap tests without graphics; something I
    want when running from home. Also added the option to a do a parallel make on the linux and dex machines.

  o I have now set up OverBlown to be automatically tested in the same way as Overture. The same test scripts
    are used except that one should specify the "package" to be "OverBlown" as this example shows:
  
      testDistribution package=OverBlown platform=dec.d.cxx cvs=true checkout=true dec=gps08


Added
   Overture/Overture/Mapping/hype
   sped up contour 20X, plotStructured
   sped up grid, grid3d, contour3d 25X, streamLine 8X
